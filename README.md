# Property Monitoring Dashboard

## Overview
This system allows the user to enter an APN (Assessor Parcel Number) and receive all cases related to that property. The system fetches property data and cases from an external source, processes the data, and presents it in a clear dashboard. To improve performance, the system stores fetched data in a local SQLite database, allowing faster repeated searches and reducing unnecessary external requests.

## How the system works
The user enters an APN in the search field. The backend fetches the property details and all related cases from an external source. The data is then stored in SQLite. On future searches, if the data already exists and is still relevant, it is returned directly from SQLite for fast performance. If needed, the data can be refreshed from the source.

## What the dashboard shows
The system displays property details such as APN,  
It displays a summary of cases including total cases, open cases, closed cases, urgent cases, overdue cases, new cases and in-progress cases. In addition, a table of all cases is shown with case ID, case type, created date, compliance date, closed date and status.

## Status meanings
- URGENT – cases where the compliance date is close
- OVERDUE – cases where the compliance date has already passed
- NEW – recently opened cases
- IN_PROGRESS – open cases that are not urgent and not overdue
- CLOSED – closed cases

## Data storage with SQLite
The project uses a local SQLite database to store fetched results. The main tables are:
- properties – stores property information
- cases – stores all cases related to each property

Using SQLite allows faster repeated searches, simple local storage, no need for a separate database server and reduced load on the external source.

## Installation and run instructions

### Prerequisites
Make sure the following are installed:
- Node.js
- npm

### Project structure
The project is expected to contain:
- server/
- client/
- package.json in the root folder

### Install dependencies
Run these commands exactly as written:

    npm install
    cd server
    npm install
    cd ..
    cd client
    npm install
    cd ..

### Run the project
Run this command from the root folder:

    npm run dev

This command starts both:
- the backend server
- the frontend client

There is no need to open two separate terminals.

### Default addresses
- Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- Backend: http://localhost:5000

## Clearing SQLite cache
If you want to force a fresh load of the data, delete the SQLite database file and run the project again.

If the database file is inside the server folder, use:

    del server\property_cases.db

Then run again:

    npm run dev

The database will be recreated automatically on the next run.

## Future improvements
If more time is available in the future, the project can be improved by:
- deploying it online
- storing the data in a more structured and secure way
- improving database design
- improving performance and refresh strategy
- improving UI/UX
- adding better error handling and monitoring

## Technologies used
- Node.js
- Express
- React
- SQLite
- Axios
- Cheerio
- Playwright

## Summary
This project provides a complete property case dashboard based on APN search. It combines external data fetching, local SQLite caching, backend processing and frontend presentation to deliver fast and useful results in a single interface.
